## Purpose
We are reviewing the New City Citibike usage data for the month of August 2019. The purpose of the review is to gain more information on usage patterns and distribution in order to roll out a similar program in Des Moine, Iowa. We created a data visualization of our results using Tableau. Please click on the hyperlink to view the tableau workbook.

# Conclusion
  We believe the citibike program is useful in densely populated urban areas where peoples average commute times are short. The service appears to be popular commuting tool for short commutes and leasure rides on the weekends. For future analysis, I would like to make two additonal visualizations:

- popular starting and ending points between subsribers and customers. So far we did not make this distinction.
- Average number of rides availed by each subsriber and each customer. This will help us determine the prices we can charge at Des Moine for casual use and monthly subsriptions.
